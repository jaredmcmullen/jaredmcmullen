Hello all, my name is Jared McMullen. I graduated from California Polytechnic State University with a degree in Industrial Engineering in June 2021. I am now pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics at Cal Poly, set to graduate in June 2022. I live for that "aha" moment. Whether that be scoring a goal in a hockey game, dropping into the perfect wave, or solving a complex problem with fearless teammates. There is nothing I love more than a challenge. I am very interested in leveraging big data to drive impactful business decisions through identifying trends and patterns using analytic tools.
